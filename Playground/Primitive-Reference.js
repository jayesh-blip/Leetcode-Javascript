//Primitives and Reference
//Primitives = number, string, null, undefined, boolean
//reference = [] {} ()
//REFERENCE-VALUE : any value that if we copy, then the actual reference is passed rather than the copy of that value. This is called reference.
//PRIMITIVE-VALUE : 

var b = 10;
var a = b;

var b = b+2;

console.log(b);
console.log(a);
